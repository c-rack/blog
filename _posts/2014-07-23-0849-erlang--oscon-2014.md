Even though there's no Erlang-specific booth (or a booth by an Erlang company),
the Erlang OSCON presence has been palpable, albeit in a small-town, gentle
way.

Day 2 is starting as this is being typed, and it will end spectacularly:
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Erlang-User-Group/events/173296812/?fromJoin=173296812">OSCON
Erlang meetup / Birds of a Feather Gathering</a>.

Between now and then, there will be a talk by
<a href="https://twitter.com/bltroutwine">Brian Troutwine</a> on
<a href="www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34281">LFE, Elixir, and Joxa
on the Erlang VM (BEAM)</a>.

Highlights from Day 1:
* Francesco passing out 25 "limited edition" copies of his and Steve's fantastic book:
  <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do">Designing
  for Scalability with Erlang/OTP<a/>
* Erlang Solutions' Office Hours at the O'Reilly area in the Expo Hall, complete with
  Portland's famous <a href="https://twitter.com/oubiwann/statuses/491645680276885504">Voodoo
  Doughnuts</a>.
* Three "Erlang" tables at lunch, full of excellence in conversation.
* Garrett Smith's talk on <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34881">Building
  a Massively Scalable Web Server In Erlang</a>.
